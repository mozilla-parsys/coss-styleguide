# coss-styleguide

A living style guide that documents CoSS design elements in front-end code.

This project contains: 

* front-end components (templates + CSS + JavaScript)
* context data (i.e. variable content)
* Fractal, a Node application that shows our components with their context data in the browser, including their documentation and variations

## Installing

Before you can see Fractal in your browser, make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org) installed, then run:

```
npm install
``` 

This will install all dependencies required.

## Running the project

To see the components in a browser, run:

```
npm start
``` 

This will spin up a dev server and let you see the Fractal environment in your browser.
